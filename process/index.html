However, some topics mentioned here will be broken down onto other pages if they are too expansive to cover on a singular page.</p> <p>So make sure to check the sidebar or use the search function!</p> <h2 id="exploration"><a href="#exploration" class="header-anchor">#</a> Exploration</h2> <p>If you're reading this as a starting developer, you'll be less involved in this step. It'll usually be the director of operations, project manager, and lead developer who will participate in client meetings to discuss and determine the requirements and scope of the project.</p> <h2 id="design"><a href="#design" class="header-anchor">#</a> Design</h2> <p>At some point after client interviews, the design team will start prototyping wireframes (rough drafts for UX/UI layouts). After a few cycles of review, they'll move forward with creating higher fidelity mockups. As design proceeds to the mockup phase, developers will start building in tandem with the design team in an iterative fashion.</p> <p>Try to keep HTML/CSS work minimal or restricted to basic layout. We don't want to lose too much work/time if there are design changes.</p> <h2 id="development"><a href="#development" class="header-anchor">#</a> Development</h2> <p>Now the list I'm providing below is the process for a <b>typical</b> project. You'll skip certain steps or completely omit them depending on the client requirements. However, if we're building a new site from the ground up, you'll usually use a majority these sections.</p> <h3 id="site-setup"><a href="#site-setup" class="header-anchor">#</a> Site Setup</h3> <p>Depending on the requirements (determined during the exploration phase), we'll have decided on the technology stack we'll use.</p> <p>A typical project will use either Craft or WordPress as a content management system. There will be breakdown tutorials on how to set up both.</p> <p>If there's a pre-existing site, there might not be a need to set up a production server. However, there might still be a need to set up a staging environment. You'll also have to investigate how to connect and push code onto those existing systems. If you're unsure, feel free to double check with the project manager or lead developer.</p> <h3 id="data-migration"><a href="#data-migration" class="header-anchor">#</a> Data Migration</h3> <p>Building on the previous point -- if there's a pre-existing site, there's a high likelihood of importing data over to the new site. We'll have some guides on how to do this for Craft and WordPress.</p> <h3 id="back-end-development-data-field-building"><a href="#back-end-development-data-field-building" class="header-anchor">#</a> Back-End Development (Data/Field Building)</h3> <p>After server setup (or pulling in existing architecture), this is where we start defining the data required for what we're building. Craft CMS has docs on how to do this <a target="_blank" href="https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/fields.html#field-types">here</a>. In WordPress, we typically use a plugin called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/">Advanced Custom Fields</a>. The great thing about about content management systems is that there's rarely a need to interact with databases directly -- you won't be creating tables and defining columns manually. So if you don't know much about SQL, you're in luck!</p> <p>(On a serious note, you should brush up on your SQL either way. It's great for building understanding on how all this stuff works under the hood.)</p> <h3 id="front-end-development"><a href="#front-end-development" class="header-anchor">#</a> Front-End Development</h3> <p>Once designs become finalized, you can begin doing more in-depth work for the HTML/CSS/Javascript portion of the site.</p> <p>I'd like to point out is it can be difficult for mockups to capture movement in UX/UI. You'll want to pull a designer aside for a quick meeting -- find out what elements have animations, sticky positions, fixed positions etc. Feel free to discuss your own cool ideas as well!</p> <p>There's abundant amounts of resources available everywhere for HTML/CSS/Javascript, all quite extensive (so I'm not going to link any). It'll probably be more beneficial instead to start learning template systems for <a target="_blank" href="https://craftcms.com/docs/3.x/dev/">Craft CMS</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/getting-started/">WordPress</a>.</p> <p><i>(P.S. Feel free to always pull another developer aside during front-end development. Many front-end solutions are open-ended, so it can be hard to decide on a single solution.)</i></p> <h2 id="testing"><a href="#testing" class="header-anchor">#</a> Testing</h2> <p>You should always be user testing as you work (after all, how will you know what you're building is working?). I (Tim) repeatedly flip between my code and the browser to check if the code is functioning as intended.</p> <p>One tip -- make sure you're not always following the steps that you intended the user to follow. Do things that a typical user wouldn't do. Click places you aren't meant to click. You'll find bugs and errors that you didn't realize had existed. It'll be difficult to think &quot;out of the box&quot; the first few times, but it gets easier as you keep up the habit AND you eventually end up with a better product.</p> <p>We will also be implementing unit testing in the coming days. It's still relatively a new subject for us, so check back on these docs for future guidelines.</p> <p>When you're approaching finalization on certain features/aspects, and you've done all the user testing you think you could possibly do, notify a project manager. We'll have either a designer or another developer review your work from other perspectives to hopefully catch even more hidden issues.</p> <h2 id="quality-assurance"><a href="#quality-assurance" class="header-anchor">#</a> Quality Assurance</h2> <p>Really just another word for more testing. At this point, the project is mostly done. However, that doesn't mean we're finished! It'll be a few cycles of code reviews, re-building, and more user testing before we even think about live deployment.</p> <h2 id="deployment"><a href="#deployment" class="header-anchor">#</a> Deployment</h2> <p>My favourite part. Now, during the previous steps, you'll be deploying as well, but those deployments will likely be to a staging server. Now it's time to make it available to the whole world. This step is usually where I'm the most excited, and also the most nervous. But if you followed all the other steps thoroughly, this part will also be the least amount of work.</p> <p>We have a tradition of ringing a gong when a project goes live, but with the pandemic we no longer have a office to do it in. Maybe we can get Terence to do it during our standup meetings?</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <!----></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
